* Parinfer
[[https://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/][Parinfer]] is a plugin that aims to make writing lisp simple. It infers the meaning of your code through whitespace.

Capabilities:
  - Making code auto-adhere to formatting conventions
  - Influencing expression-nesting with indentation
  - Maintaining indentation when expressions shift
  - Allowing Paredit-like features without hotkeys

** Requirements
1. Emacs (25+) compiled with Dynamic Module support.
2. Running on MacOS/Linux, with Windows support coming soon.

** Installation
*** From Source
1. compile libraries from parinfer-rust
2. save libraries somewhere on path
3. clone parinfer-rust-mode and add to load path
4. tell parinfer-rust-mode where where the parinfer-rust library is stored
*** Manual
After you download parinfer-rust-mode, add the following to your init.el file
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/parinfer-rust-mode")
  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode 'parinfer-rust-mode)
#+END_SRC

*** MELPA
Coming soon...
** Commands
| Key   | Command                     | Description                                                                                                                             |
|-------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C-c s | parinfer-switch-mode        | Quickly switch between paren, indent, and smart modes                                                                                   |
| C-c d | Disable parinfer-rust-mode | Sometimes you need to make a change or undo things quickly and the easiest way to accomplish that is with parinfer-rust-mode disabled. |

** Modes
Parinfer can operate under three different modes when writing lisp.
*** Paren
Paren Mode gives you full control of parens, while Parinfer corrects indentation. You can still adjust indentation, but you won't be able to indent/dedent past certain boundaries set by parens on previous lines.

*** Indent
Indent Mode gives you full control of indentation, while Parinfer corrects or inserts close-parens where appropriate. Specifically, it only touches the groups of close-parens at the end of each line.

*** Smart
Smart Mode is like Indent Mode, but it tries to preserve the structure too.

** parinfer-mode
There is an alternate implementation of Parinfer for Emacs called [[https://github.com/DogLooksGood/parinfer-mode][parinfer-mode]]. It currently has support for Parinfer's "paren" and "indent". Additionally, it has had experimental support for "smart" mode, however, this has remained hidden on a branch and not accessible from MELPA for over a year.
parinfer-smart-mode aims to be a simpler adaptation of Parinfer that just offers "smart mode", leveraging the parinfer-rust plugin to do most of the heavy lifting.
** Known Issues
- Multiple cursors do not work as intended
- Does not play well with other modes that insert parens or manage whitespace. If you have modes like electric-pair-mode or hungry-delete-mode enabled, you may want to disable them for any mode that has parinfer-rust-mode enabled
